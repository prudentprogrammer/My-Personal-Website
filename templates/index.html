          <p id="about_me_paragraph">Hi! I'm a software developer. I make mobile apps on the iOS platform as well as web apps. I primarily work a lot with Objective-C/Swift, Python, and occasionally JavaScript.
            I love creating apps that help the society and enrich the quality of their lives in areas such as health, music, and productivity. 
            <!-- Currently, I'm exploring the Flutter framework (in my recreational time) and am excited to uncover the possibilities it can bring in the mobile space. -->
            In addition, I have acquired some skills in Data Science and Data Engineering through my previous internships at UC Davis and Altice. I love learning about new technologies and the possibilities which can be uncovered by them. Oh also, interesting algorithmic problems always excite me! ðŸ˜„</p>
